            As a child, I vividly remember dreaming of becoming a news reporter, fueled by my fascination with storytelling and the power of the media. 
            The idea of being on the front lines, uncovering stories, and keeping the public informed excited my young imagination. However, as I grew older, my interests evolved, and I found myself 
            increasingly drawn to the world of information and communication technology (ICT). The allure of mastering the intricacies of software and technology became irresistible. Now, as I pursue my education in ICT 
            and work towards becoming a software engineer, my childhood dream has transformed into a passion for creating innovative solutions and contributing to the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
            While my path may have diverged from journalism, my goal remains constant: to achieve financial success and stability.
             By becoming a software engineer, I aim to leverage my skills to not only fulfill my professional ambitions but also to secure a prosperous future.</p>
